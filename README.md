# Machine-Learning-Lab-7-Programs
A1. Continue your unfinished experiments from last lab class.

A2. Use cross-validation techniques (RandomizedSearchCV()) technique to tune the hyperparameters for your perceptron and MLP networks.

A3. Tabulate your results with various other classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, RandomForest, CatBoost, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Naïve-Bayes. Tabulate your results for your problem using different performance metrics.

Optional Section:

O1.Study the usage of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)for usage as explainable tool for ML model behaviour. Use this tool for identifying feature importances for your classification problem.

O2. Study the features of LIME(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)tool. Understand the ways the tool can be used for explaining the model behaviour. Use this tool to understand your model’s behaviour.
